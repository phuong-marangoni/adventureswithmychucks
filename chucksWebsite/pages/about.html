    <p class="body-info">I am Phuong. I am an avid Converse Chuck Taylor All Star collector. Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars are also known simply as "chucks". I have been collecting chucks since 2007. </p>
    <p> I remember it like it was yesterday when my parents took me to Journeys by the mall to buy new shoes for the start of the school year. My sisters all had a pair of chucks at the time and surprisingly enough, I hated them before I grew to love them. All the people around me that I ever saw with chucks on had feet that were much bigger than me so I always thought they looked like clown shoes. It wasn't until I came across the on-sale pair of Chocolate plaid chucks at that Journeys store did I show some level of interest.</p>
    <p> I ended up picking that pair because it looked less like clown shoes and was neutral enough of a color that I could wear it with almost any outfit. As I wore that pair throughout the school year, it got softer and even more comfortable to walk in. I grew to love that pair of chucks...
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Permanent Marker', cursive;">The Expansion</h1>

    <p> Senior year of high school came and went. I was set to graduate and my parents gifted me with a brand new pair of red, high-top chucks as a graduation gift. I went on to college and chose a ridiculously stressful major (that I wanted to switch out of many times but stuck with until the end) and throughout my initial years of college, I would use my small allowance from my parents to save up for my next pair of chucks as a form of "stress relief". By the time I was a sophmore in college, I had a nice little collection of ~20 pairs. I would often go to the nearby Converse Outlet or buy youth-sized chucks to get the best deal possible.
    </p>
    <p> In my junior year of college, I landed my first internship that turned into a year around student researcher job. I did research for a nearby Government organization and was making enough that I no longer needed my parents to support my weekly allowance for food, savings or etc... My chucks collection ultimately grew as Converse began releasing more and more collaborations with various brands and franchises. I grew to appreciate the sneaker as a form of art where the sneaker upper was the canvas.
