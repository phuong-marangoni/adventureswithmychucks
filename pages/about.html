    <p class="body-info">Hi! Thanks for visiting! I am Phuong. I am an avid Converse Chuck Taylor All Star collector. Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars are also known simply as "chucks". I have been collecting chucks since high school. </br>

      <br> Surprisingly, it was not love at first sight with chucks for me. I remember my parents taking me to Journeys to buy new shoes for the start of the school year. My sisters all owned chucks already and I hated them before I grew
      to love them. They just looked like clown shoes! It wasn't until I came across the on-sale pair of chocolate plaid chucks at that Journeys store did it begin to pique my interest.

      <br> <br>

      I received my second pair of chucks as a high school graduation gift from my parents. I loved them because they were my first pair of high tops and they were <span class="strong"> red </span> (my favorite color). Throughout college, Converse
      continued releasing more collaborations and by my sophmore year in college I was at over 30 pairs. I worked part-time during college and the Converse collecting had plagued me before I even realized it. I simply loved the different colors
      and designs they had. I fell more in love with the patterned chucks as they were like art to me. As college came and went, I continued to receive chucks as gifts from family during the holidays and my birthday. Today, I currently own a little over 150 pairs of chucks. I
      don't have plans to purchase anymore unless it's a collaboration or design I really love.

      <br><br>

      These chucks are my passion and one of my dream jobs is to work at Converse one day. I may consider it when I retire from my full-time job in a few decades!
